# How piglatin works:
# glove -> oveGlay
# pig -> igPay
# happy -> appyHay
# duck -> uckDay
#eat -> eatyay


# Planning

# get sentence from user
original = input("Please enter a sentence: ").strip().lower()

# split sentence into words
words = original.split()

# loop through words and convert to pig latin
new_words = []

# if starts with vowel, just add "yay"

# Otherwise, move the first consonant cluser to end and add "ay"
for word in words:
    if word[0] in "aeiou":
        new_word = word + "yay"
        new_words.append(new_word)

        vowel_pos = 0
        for letter in word:
            if letter not in "aeiou":
                vowel_pos += 1

# output final string
